The scripts described here can be used for generating a Nutrient Conversion Table (NCT) to be use with the Malawi Integrated Household Survey (IHS) round 4 (2016-2017), and round 5 (2019-2020) with slight modifications. 

This protocol serves as documentation of the food matches that are performed in the back-end of the MAPS tool{LINK}. 

Last Updated: 2024-08-12

## Note 

The original matches were performed to the dictionary (more info here), because there are foods that are not available in any FCT, the "MAPS-version" substituted non-available foods (eg. unshelled groundnuts) to available (shelled groundnuts). Then modifications on the Edible Portion (EP) or others are applied.


**Change log**
V.3.0.0 - updated on  2024-12-26: Fixed items that had wrong matches, permanently.
V.2.0.0 - updated on  2023-05-31: Fixed items without matches on any of the FCTs used in MAPS tool, changed to better matches in the FCTs.


# Introduction

The document contains information on the food matching for Malawi household surveys, including IHS4 () and IHS5 ().


The step one is matching the food list to the dictionary. 
The step two is matching the dictionary to the MAPS FCT library and check for missing values in foods, and then in nutrients. 
Step three, change the dictionary matches for the MAPS NCT to dictionary codes available in FCT. 

# Updating food matches to be performed within the MAPS tool.

 - Checking excluded in IHS5 script (ihs5_genus.R)
 - Here's the changes that were made however no serious issue or good reason seemed recoded (beside data needs)
 - Not changing them back.


```{r}

# Checking excluded in IHS5 script (ihs5_genus.R)
food_list %>% 
filter(ID_3 %in% # Citrus and orange sweet potato from boiled version
        c("1530.06", "1321.02", "1322.02", "1324.02", 
          # Changed green and roasted maize to boiled 
          "1290.01.01", "1290.01.02" , "1290.01.03",
          # Yeast and baking powders 
              "F1232.07", "F1232.06"
        ))  %>% View()

```

NOTE: Ca values in baking powder ("F1232.07") are high, specially **extremely** although plausible in US19(18369)


```{r}

# Checking yeast and baking powder compo values
fct_dict %>% 
  filter(ID_3 %in%  
           c( "F1232.07", "F1232.06"))  %>%
  select(source_fct, ID_3, fdc_id,  food_desc,  CAmg, SEmcg, VITA_RAEmcg, VITB12mcg)
  View()

```

Some food needed a better match, for instance, beef was matched to "with bones" however, the edible portion used was 1. Hence, we change it to a one-to-many match using beef with three fat content and w/o bones. 

beef, lean, with bones, fresh, raw (21111.01.01) --> Added beef w/o bones, including ground raw. c("21111.02.03", "21184.01.02", "21111.02.01", "21111.02.02")


```{r}

food_list %>% 
  filter(ID_3 %in%  # Three traditional drinks used the same code ()
           c( "24310.02.01",
              # Wrongly coded Nkate
              "F0022.06" ,
              # Changing food consumed at restaurant
              "F1061.01","F1232.05"
              ))  %>% View()

```


Here we are fixing some of the issues with the dictionary codes


```{r}

#Meal eaten at restaurant (vendor) c(21116.02, 21121.04) -->  F1061.01 
#TODO: Generate a recipe c(F1061.01,F1232.05 )
food_list$ID_3[food_list$code == "829"] <- "F1061.01,F1232.05"
# Chicken at vendor (assumed cooked)
food_list$ID_3[food_list$code == "824"] <- "F1061.02,F1061.01"
# Better matches for the nkate and zikondamoyo
food_list$ID_3[food_list$code == "836"] <- "F0022.07,F1232.39,F1232.40,F1232.38"

```


```{r}

food_list %>% 
  filter(ID_3 %in%  # Three traditional drinks used the same code ()
           c( 
             "24310.02.01" ))  
```



```{r}

                                "23161.01.01", "21119.01.01"))

106 - Rice: We changed from multiple (imported & local, white) to only rice grain, local, white, dried, raw (23161.02.01), because it is the only reported in FAO SUA (2015-2017).

# Food items reported in the IHS4 without any matches

Thobwa: 24230.03.03 - maize- and millet-fermented beverage, change description in dictionary & found a match for millet-fermented beverage on WA19.
  
Maize ufa madeya (bran flour): 39120.04.01 - maize bran, flour, raw --> No information, changing to whole grain flour (23120.03.01)

[313] - Groundnut fresh (unshelled): 142.03 - peanuts, fresh, unshelled, raw. No information on fresh peanuts, hence we need to adjust the quantity from fresh consumption to dry E.g., 100g of fresh weight will be 100*(100-50)/(100-10), and matched to dry peanuts. This is important to not over-estimate the nutrient content from the food consumption.

```{r}

#### Orange fleshed sweet potato

We are using an allocation factor of .162 (16.2%), according to G.O. analysis of the coverage of OFSP in Malawi (Osman et al. *unpublished*).

# Roasted sweet potatoes: (1530.07) sweet potatoes, orange-flesh, roasted
# Boiled sweet potatoes:  (1530.06) sweet potatoes, orange-flesh, boiled

## Checking Vitamin A values (VITA_RAEmg)

- Items without values: 	

cabbages, head, fresh, raw (1212.01) - New code: could be improved with an average of cabbages.

blackjack leaves, raw (1290.9.16) -> Adding more items to the list: following IHS5:
 1. leaves, cat's whiskers, raw, cleome gynadra  (1290.9.07)
 2. jew's mallow leaves, raw (1290.9.15)
 

sugar sweetned beverage, concentrate (24490.01) - Assumed zero (no need to change because multple match)

# barb, silver, smoked, raw (1505.06)

north african catfish, fresh, raw (1501.02) - recode upsidedown catfish (1501.09) bc it is the same specie as in the MAFOODS. 
tilapia, fresh, raw (1501.05) - recode to fillet ("1503.08", "1503.03")

maize, green, roasted (1290.01.02) - Not completed bc multi-matched

cassava root, roasted (1520.01.05) - Not completed bc multi-matched


## Checking Iron values (FEmg) & Zinc (ZNmg)

Small animal ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ rabbit, mice, etc.: (21119.01.01) rat meat, fresh, raw - Not completed bc multi-matched.

## Checking Se values (SEmcg)


```{r}

food_list$ID_3[food_list$code %in% c("313")] <-  "142.01" # Changing to dry
# Changing to whole grain (applying extration rates)
food_list$ID_3[food_list$code %in% c("102")] <-  "23120.03.01" 
# Boiled sweet potato - using only one bc no difference in Se compo
food_list$ID_3[food_list$code %in% c("831")] <-  "1520.01.01" 
food_list$ID_3[food_list$code %in% c("832")] <-  "1520.01.01" 

```


Changing dictionary codes, this is useful when more than one food item in the food list was matched to the same foods, for example, for fish.

```{r}

# Changing to small dried (barb) to cyprianid (barb)
food_list$ID_3[food_list$ID_3 %in% c("1505.03")] <-  "1505.07" 
#Infant cereals to infant food, cereal, mixed
food_list$ID_3[food_list$ID_3 == "23991.01.01"] <- "23991.01.07"

```

```{r}
food_list %>% filter(!code %in% unique(fct$code)) %>%
  distinct() 


fct_cover %>% filter(grepl("ground", food_desc, ignore.case = TRUE), 
  SEmcg>1.9 & SEmcg <3) %>% View()

fct_cover %>% filter(grepl("ground", food_desc, ignore.case = TRUE), 
  as.numeric(WATERg)>50) %>% View()
```




#EDIBLE: SUGAR CANE
Sugar Cane: (1802.01) sugar canes - recode (1802.02) cane sugar juice. We need to adjust the quantity consumed to account for the difference in the edible portion. 

## IHS5-foodid matching to Genus

There are some items that should be removed:

 1) [106] There are two codes for identical item = rice. We amended genus to account for imported and local rice production hence, differentiate between the two. Unless, it is specified, we will sort for local when possible. 
 2) [510] It is a redundant code, as mice is actually rabbit meat. We should remove and use only rabbit until we found mice. 
 3) [816] Remove sweets, chocolate with milk because acc. to Gareth inputs that's hardly found in Malawi. We identified an issue that with the other code that should be solved at FCT level 
 4) [832] Remove orange-sweet potato. It also has an issue that it should be fixed at FCT level.
 5) [836] A typo in food genus that was solved in version 2.5 samosa and banana cake sharing the same id, was the cause of this error. Now it's solved. Hence it doesn't need to be removed any more. 
 
IHS5 - genus matches were sent to Gareth Osman to double-check that the assumptions made were consistent with Malawi reality. 

Below are the comments to be solved:

 1) 118 - 'MAIZE UFA RAW MADEYA (bran flour - unprocessed), code 118, is missing. --> Fixed
 2) 412 - Tinned vegetables (specify) change to Tinned beans. = Tinned, beans (MW02_0003) --> Fixed
 3) 106 - rice was duplicated --> Fixed. 
 4) 829 - restaurant meals ---> Nsima (MW01_0031 - F1232.05) - check min values for this recipe, chicken (MW03_0010 - F1061.01), rape leaves, boiled (MW04_0020*Retention factor), change to amaranth leaves, boiled (MW04_0010 - ) --> Fixed but w/o retention factors
 5) 816 - Change compo to candies
 6) 708 - Add infant formula data
 
-Recalculate min values for all sweet potato using Edward:

-Provisional fix to create OFSP version

 6) 832 and 831 - Add b) version w/ orange: copy and paste values and 
 7) 204 - OFSP
 8) 203 - WFSP
 
Changed value of VITA_RAE of (831) white boiled sweet potato to match raw white sweet potato adjusted w/ retention factor. We did not do a water adjustment because the water content difference in water was <10%, hence according to FAO/ INFOODS Guidelines there is no need to water adjust (`r round(2.213000*(100-76.00/100-77.28), 2)`)
 
Make a note to fix all recipes in MAFOODS.

- Check ref for small fish:

 9)  5023        Sun Dried fish (Small Variety)     
 10) 5033        Fresh fish (Small Variety)  
 11) 5123        Smoked fish (Small Variety) 

- Check infant feeding formula
