 - local egg == local breed egg
 - beef, Lamb/mutton, pork, goat, moderately fat
 - Game meat [94] is dried and salted, should double check w/ consumption!
 #Snail - I used normal snail because of the name and the image of the photo aid.
#Maybe it should be an average
#Seafood [105] - calculate the average
#Canned fish/seafood [106] - we used mackerel but we could do an average
#Baby milk powder, we picked 3months, but we could do an average
#Double-check because it's fortified.
#Milk tinned unsweetened == evaporated milk
#Coffee [120] - powder
#Chocolate drinks [121] - Ovaltine? 
#Sugar - used unfortified but there is one fortified for Nigeria (Vit.A)
#Unground Ogbono [142] == 06_008 - Dikanut (Ene-Obong et al., 2013)
#Ground Ogbono [143] == 06_008 - Dikanut - Not powder 
#Pepper - not powder
#Melon seed (e- for all 2 [145, 146, 147] = Egusi
#Water - only tap (used for bottle and sachet)
#Juice canned, sweetened - but it can be averaged of different juices
#Pito - sorghum beer, we could do an average with millet
 
 FISH:
 
 - Fresh fish [100], we could do an average of all the possible or to try to identify the reporting unit and use it accordingly. Most of them are reported as small piece or heap. Therefore, we could be mullet and sardines for heaps and catfish for small and medium fresh pieces. We will leave out the mormyrid? for big because there is no "big piece" reported. 
 - Dried fish, check back the selection! It might be worth to add clayfish, although it is not fish but shrimps, but it is highly consumed particularly in the Northern region of the country (Ene-Obong et al., 2013)
 
 - Frozen fish [101] could be mackerel  (see photo aid) - FCT is fillet, so double check EP.
 - For smoked maybe used average of dried and grilled (see photo aid)
 - Snail - I used normal snail because of the name and the image of the photo aid.
 - Maybe it should be an average
 - Seafood [105] - calculate the average
 - Canned fish/seafood [106] - we used mackerel but we could do an average

We have checked the "supply" (consumption) for NGA in FBS to try to identify if fishes are coming from the sea (marine) or from the lake (freshwater) because it would have an impact particularly in iodine. 

We have check the raw fish and seafood nutritent supply. Regarding ZN and FE the only items that are higher (>2mg/100g) are clams, shrimps, sea snails and crab. Only the Mola carplet a small fish w/ viscera, fins (eaten whole) is the one making a difference. Similarly for Vit.A Mola is the fish with highest Vit.A supply in the whole Fish and seafood section. Also, mackerel is supplying high amounts (third place).


```{r fish, echo=FALSE}

#Supply of fish in NGA acc. to FBS for 2014-2018

fbs %>% filter(str_detect(original_name, "fish"),
               country_id == "NGA") %>% group_by(original_name) %>% summarise(mean_consumed = mean(amount_consumed_in_g)) %>% arrange(desc(mean_consumed)) %>% knitr::kable()

#Nutrient supply of raw fish and seafood in WAFCT

wafct %>% filter(str_detect(code, "09_")) %>%
  filter(str_detect(fooditem, "raw")) %>%
  select(code, fooditem, ENERC1, ZN, FE, VITA_RAE) %>%
  pivot_longer(., cols =c(ENERC1, FE, ZN, VITA_RAE),
               names_to = "nutrient") %>% 
  filter(nutrient != "ENERC1") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(nutrient, value)) + geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "FCT", y = "(mg/100g-EP-DW) in fish and products")


```

## Modified items

We are including some "calculated food items", here we will include:

 - Average values: items that were calculated as mean value for more than one item, for example for meat pie or fresh leafy vegetables. The items averaged will be included. 
 - Recipe calculation: items that are calculated as a different protion
 - Cooked items: when an item was reported as cooked but we only could found a raw version. For example, 


*Gari - yellow*

The gari - yellow [33], we have considered as Gari(fufu) /Eba - fermented cassava, flour with palm oil (yellow) (see ref: [https://scialert.net/fulltext/?doi=pjn.2009.1512.1516]). We needed to find the amount of oil to calculate the "recipe". We have used an approximation based on the assumption that the cassava paste will be fried in red palm oil. Hence, we have choosen the fat uptake for potatoes from (BognÃ¡r, 2002, Table 31: deep fry B) and calculate a conversion factor base on the % of palm oil and cassava gari. Note that it is all based on raw ingredients as we have not accounted for any losses due to cooking (aka we did not apply rentention factors). Then, for reference we have checked the food item "fufu of yam" [02_087] in wafct (VITA_RAE == 499), and our final VITA_RAE is lower (conservative estimates), as they have used 60g of red palm oil (for about 1017g total recipe weight) and adjusted for cooking. 

*Seafood (lobster, crab, prawns, etc)*

The Seafood (lobster, crab, prawns, etc) [105], we did an average of several raw items. We have not included clams due to high Fe content, as it could bias the results. 


##Food items to check

1) Millet - Particularly Fe content, it seems too high - We are using [01_017] but it seems that the other millet, combined varietes has the same value. Use Kenfct instead?
2) Cassava, flour (fermented?) - check Vit. B12 what's going on?
3) Fish selection, particularly for dried fish
4) Milk, it seems that it's region specific - double-check with the team but I think for the MN we are interested in, I don't think it's worth the trouble.


```{r milk, echo=FALSE}

#Nutrient content of different type of milk in WAFCT

wafct %>% filter(str_detect(fooditem, "Milk"), WATER > 70) %>% 
  select(code, fooditem, WATER, VITA_RAE, ZN, FE, VITB12)


```
