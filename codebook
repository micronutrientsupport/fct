tagname, description, unit, method, observations

EDIBLE1, edible portion, g, , from market to household,
EDIBLE2, edible portion, g, , from household to consumption,
SOP, sum of proximates, g, WATER + PROTCNT + FAT + CHOAVLDF + FIBFG + ALC + ASH, , 
ENERC1, energy, kcal,  , ENERC is the original form. We hace adde number (1) to identify that is kcal
ENERC2, energy, kJ, , ENERC is the original form. We hace adde number (2) to identify that is kJ
WATER, water, g, , , 
NT, total nitrogen, g, kjeldahl method, 
PROTCNT, total protein, g, NT*XN, calculated by total nitrogen multiplied by nitrogen factors (XN) (Jones factors). It could be multiply by Atwater gereral factor (6.25)
FAT, total fat, g, mixed solvent extraction, ,
FATCE, total fat, g, continous extraction, this includes Soxhlet extraction. It is considered low quality due to understimation for some food items and should be clearly identified in FCT
FASAT, saturated FA, g, , ,
FAMS, mono-unsaturated FA, g, , ,
FAPU, polyunsaturated FA, g, , ,
CHOLE, cholesterol, mg, , ,
CHOCSM, total carbohydrate calculated by summation, g, calculated by summation, include fibre,
CHOAVLDF, available carbohydrate by summation, g, 100 - (WATER + PROTCNT + FAT (FATCE) + ALC + ASH + FIBTG (FIBC)), 
SUGAR, total sugar, g, sum of free mono- and di-saccharides, , this tag can be used for unknown method as well
SUGAD, added sugar, g, , , 
FIBC, crude fibre, g, , this is considered as low quality value and the use should be avoided when possible
FIGBT, FIBTG, total dietary fibre, g, AOAC Prosky method, , 
STARCH, total starch, g, , , 
ALC, alcohol, g, , , 
ASH, ash, g, , , 
CA, calcium, mg, , , 
FE, total iron, mg, , , 
MG, magnesium, mg, , , 
P, phosphorus, mg, , , 
K, potassium, mg, , , 
NA, sodium, mg, , ,
ZN, zinc, mg, , , 
CU, copper, mg, , ,
MN, manganese, mcg, , , 
ID, iodine, mcg, , , 
SE, selenium, mcg, , , 
VITA_RAE, total vitamin A activity expressed in mcg retinol activity equivalent, mcg, RAE = mcg retinol+ 1/12 mcg beta-carotene + 1/24 mcg other provitamin A carotenoids, , 
VITA, vitamin A calculated by summation of the vitamin A activities of retinol and the active carotenoids, mcg, Total vitamin A activity = mcg retinol + 1/6 mcg beta-carotene + 1/12 mcg other provitamin A carotenoids, , 
RETOL, Retinol, mcg, , , 
THIA, thiamin, mg, , , 
RIBF, riboflavin, mg, , , 
NIA, niacin preformed, mg, , , , 
VITB6, total vitamin B6, g, , , ,
FOL, total folate, mcg, , , ,
FOLDFE, dietary folate equivalent, g, folate eq. = food folate + 1.7 x synthetic folic acid, synthetic is multiplied by 1.7 to account for its higher activity,
FOLDF, food folate, g, (determined by microbiological assay, folate occurring naturally in food,
FOLAC, folic acid, g, , synthetic folic acid used in fortification, 
VITB12, vitamin B12, mcg, , , 
PANTAC, pantothenic acid, mg, , , ,
BIOT, biotin, mcg, , , ,
VITC, vitamin C, mg,
VITD, vitamin D, mcg, calculated by summation of ergocalciferol and cholecalciferol, ,
VITE ,vitamin E, mg, calculated by summation of the vitamin E activities of the active tocopherols and tocotrienols expressed as alpha-tocopherol equivalents, it can be used when the method is unkown
PHYT, phytic acid, mg, unknown or variable method, , It should be written with a dash (-) but it would cause problems with R
