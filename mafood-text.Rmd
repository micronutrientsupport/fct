## Getting the data


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Getting from untidy to tidy format

The pages list of the pages where the food compo is located are divided per food group in the pdf. They are as follow:

pages = c(21:27,
         36:37, 
         41:47,
         53:56,
         60:62,
         65,
         67:75,
         78)
         
There are some issues with some of the pages, for example with the page 56, because the table area in that page is smaller than the other. Hence, we are extracting that page independently. And added as new element of the list. 

Then, the list item 22 (corresponding to page 62) has an extra column (17), because a extra column  (X) is coerced, we have eliminated and all items in the list are now at 16 column, making the rest of the flow working without any issues. 




### 1) 

MAFOODS design is a three rows per food item, hence we will have Energy (kCal), Starch (g), Vit-RE(mcg) in three consecutive rows. 
We are going to get those three rows and paste it as columns side by side using a loop. Keep in mind that we can't index (mwi[[i]]) with value 0. Hence, we need to do a work around. 

We have realized that if we only extract 3 rows, we are missing very important information, mainly the information for nutrients in the 3rd row (i.e., most of the vitamins), hence, we are extracting 4 rows. This is originating an issue with those items at the middle of the page, because it is picking the page number (see number 19 and 20 within food items MW01_0005 and MW01_0015). This difference in format means among other that the distance between one food item and the next instead of being 4 rows is 3 rows. Hence, we are getting a duplication of one item per page in the fourth row (mwi[[4]]). 

This needs to be solved, otherwise we might be introducing some values per food item that are incorrect. 


All the above have been solved by using the area of table. And then, doing some minor amendments. 


We are grouping together the three rows of the names, and extracting water content from the first row name. In addition, we are searching for [], because according to MAFOODS compilers: "Square brackets [ ] mean compilers are not confident
with value reported.". we are creating a "metadata" table with TRUE/FALSE according to the presence of []. We could change the variable names as nut.low, such as `water.low`.

Round brackets ( ) indicate that the value reported is based on an assumption. For example, vitamin B12 in vegetables. We are not including this in the metadata, for now. 



### 2) Tidying using the "old" script

*List minor format changes and solutions* 
 -[] some bits can be copied from fct_cleaning.Rmd

*Amend wrong values w/ Joy et al. values* 

When we identify the food items that were coded as reference 10, which was the reference that we found that has flaws in the conversion from dry matter to fresh weight. There are 17 food items in the MAFOODS (from the excel file) and the same number for the mwi_clean (from the pdf) however the list of food items are different in both data sources!!

The four items that are different are two included according to the pdf (first two) and two included according to the excel (second two):

"MW04_0008" - Green beans 
"MW04_0009" - Green pepper
"MW04_0011" - Amaranth leaves
"MW04_0012" - Black jack leaves

The two food items reported in the pdf that came from Joy et al. () study, it does not seem plausible. We checked the "Green pepper" data from the original source and the values doesn't match. Then, for green beans, it is not reported at all. 



 - []Double check all values and specially 
 - []Check MAFOODS - 5010 - Sweet potato - MAPS-MAFOODS - MW01_0065
 - []Generate the ID-code for Joy et al., paper data too

*MAPS formatting and check GENuS codes* 
 - [] can we add some extra ones?



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

## Next steps for MAFOODS

1) Add new GENuS code
2) Check quality of the data
3) Complete missing values:
  3.1) with AHHA FCT data (imputed)
  3.2) w/ new data (?)
  3.3) MAPS tool fixing
