## Getting the data


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Getting from untidy to tidy format

### 1) 

MAFOODS design is a three rows per food item, hence we will have Energy (kCal), Starch (g), Vit-RE(mcg) in three consecutive rows. 
We are going to get those three rows and paste it as columns side by side using a loop. Keep in mind that we can't index (mwi[[i]]) with value 0. Hence, we need to do a work around. 

We have realized that if we only extract 3 rows, we are missing very important information, mainly the information for nutrients in the 3rd row (i.e., most of the vitamins), hence, we are extracting 4 rows. This is originating an issue with those items at the middle of the page, because it is picking the page number (see number 19 and 20 within food items MW01_0005 and MW01_0015). This difference in format means among other that the distance between one food item and the next instead of being 4 rows is 3 rows. Hence, we are getting a duplication of one item per page in the fourth row (mwi[[4]]). 

This needs to be solved, otherwise we might be introducing some values per food item that are incorrect. 

We are grouping together the three rows of the names, and extracting water content from the first row name. In addition, we are searching for [], because according to MAFOODS compilers: "Square brackets [ ] mean compilers are not confident
with value reported.". we are coding that variables as `water.low`

X.1...3 == Energy_in_kcal 

All the above have been solved by using the area of table. And then, doing some minor ammendments. 




```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
