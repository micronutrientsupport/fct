## Matching ess3 with KENFCT

We are only interested in energy in kcal, vitamin A (RAE) and zn. 

There are 29 food items w/o a match. We are checking whether they are available or nor in KENFCT.

List of items not found and possible exchange (if any)

1. There is no refined wheat grain
2. There is no barley
3. Haricot beans, lima bean
4. Niger seeds
5. Linseed 
6. Kocho 
7. Coffee, beverage, instant coffee powder (Check what type of coffee and units) - Fixed
8. Bula
9. Sheep/mutton meat
10. Injera
11. Oil - only red palm oil
12. Soft drinks/Soda
13. Beer
14. Tella

Need to change code
 1. Chicken - was wrong code. Need to fix it from fuzzy_matching input

## Matching ess4 with KENFCT

There were 29 items w/o a match. From those w/o a match, there are some that they do have a match in KENFCT but Genus is missing, i.e., rice. Others, has no matched. Note that those items w/o a match in ess3 did not have a match in ess4 either. 

Missing GENUS: 

1. Rice  
2. Fenugreek
3. Mung bean == Gram, green, dry, raw (*Vigna radiata*) 
4. Sesame seed
5. Sunflower seed
6. Kale - found two type - choose Ethiopian kale
7. Lettuce
8. Garlic - fresh (around ~60% moisture content)
9. Papaya
10. Carrot
11. Beetroot

Missing item (see above ess3) +:

1. Oat - only oat bran or oatmeal (high mosture content)
2. Vetches - Faba bean/ broad bean
3. Processed pulses (Shiro) - Chickpeas flour
4. Moringa leaves
5. Hops (gesho)

## Matching ess4 with WAFCT

We found matches for five of the 18 foods. We will proceed to check the missing values, whether they are present in WAFCT or not:

Missing GENUS in WAFCT:

1. palm oil - refined
2. Oat
3. Moringa leaves

Missing items in WAFCT:

1. Wheat - refined grain --> we are going to change it to refined flour. 
2. Barley --> (USDA = FDC ID: 170284) 
3. Niger seeds --> Indian FCT (black) H015 VITA_RAE = retinol +beta-caro/12+caretonoid/24 == 2.15/12+295/24 ==12.47
4. Linseed --> Indian FCT H014
5. Kocho --> Biblio1 = Bosha et al. (2016) (no VITA) 
6. Bula --> biblio2 = Daba, T. and Shigeta, M., 2016 (no VITA)
5. Purchased injera --> Biblio3 = Abebe, et al., 2007 + Teff grain, boiled (WAFCT = 01_186)
6. Vetches --> change to horse bean
7. Processed pulses - Shiro --> Chick peas flour (USDA = FDC ID: 174288 )
8. Gesho - NA

Because some of these items are only consumed in Ethiopia, there was no information in the FCTs. Hence, we extacted some values from published literature:

Values for Zn were extracted from: [Zinc (mg/100 g)]

Biblio3: Abebe, Y., Bogale, A., Hambidge, K. M., Stoecker, B. J., Bailey, K., & Gibson, R. S. (2007). Phytate, zinc, iron and calcium content of selected raw and prepared foods consumed in rural Sidama, Southern Ethiopia, and implications for bioavailability. Journal of Food Composition and Analysis, 20(3), 161–168. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfca.2006.09.003

1. Barley, white flour: roasted, milled - 3.29 - no moisture content reported...
2. Niger seed: whole - 2.73 - - no moisture content reported...
3. Kocho, fresh: pulp [moisture(Q1-Q3) 85g/100g(82, 86)] - 0.09 (0.08, 0.15) - Not used...
4. Bulla: desiccated juice from enset pulp [moisture(Q1-Q3) 57 (54, 58)] - 0.07 (0.05, 0.09)
5. Injera: from fermented white and red teff dough [moisture 67.8] - 0.93

socio-cultural values”, Agriculture and Food Sciences Research, Vol. 3 No. 2, pp. 66-74.

Vit. A Rae - three high values:
Moringa 
Carrot -> USDA = Vitamin A, RAE	835µg
Butter -> USDA = Vitamin A, RAE	758µg
